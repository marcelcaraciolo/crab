This library intends to be a reference for recommendation engines in Python Programming language.
It is written in pure python to maximize the cross-platform issue and exposes the recommendation logic to your application by easy to use API REST via web services. 
The library is extensible, so the user can create new representations, algorithms and the design is optimized for performance.

It is also open-source so everyone can use it.
